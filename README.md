# Vet Clinic Backend (POC)

Welcome to the **Vet Clinic Backend**! This project serves as the backend API for the Vet Clinic Admin Panel, designed as a **proof of concept (POC)** and learning project. It is built using **Node.js** and **Express** for server-side development and **PostgreSQL** as the database.

> **Note**: This project is part of my journey to becoming a full-stack web developer and is ongoing. The backend provides essential data and functionality to support the frontend admin panel.

## üìö Project Overview

The backend API is designed to manage clinic data, including doctors, animals, clients, products, appointments, and analytics. It handles requests from the frontend application and provides the necessary data to support various operations. It is just a common setup as far as I see as I am still learning in creating backend service for an application.

### Key Features

- **RESTful API**: Implements a RESTful architecture for easy interaction with the frontend.
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities for managing clinic data.
- **Authentication**: Secure API endpoints with authentication middleware.
- **Data Validation**: Validate incoming data to ensure integrity and security.
- **Logging**: Maintain logs for tracking requests and errors.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building scalable server-side applications.
- **Express**: Web framework for building APIs and handling routing.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for securely storing clinic data.
- **Middleware**: Various middleware for authentication, logging, and error handling.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v14+ and npm (or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/))
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) installed and running

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Arvey18/vet-clinic-backend
   cd vet-clinic-backend
   ```
2. Install Dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install or yarn install
   ```
3. Start Application:
   ```
   npm run dev or yarn dev
   ```
4. Use Postman to test available API as of the moment
   ```bash
   /register-users
   /login
   /logout
   /profile/:email
   ```

### What to Learn?

- **Enhancing API Security**: Exploring advanced methods and best practices for securing APIs against common vulnerabilities, including authentication strategies (like JWT), rate limiting, and input validation. Aiming to implement robust security measures that protect sensitive data and ensure only authorized access to resources.

- **Creating Comprehensive API Documentation**: Focusing on developing clear and effective API documentation that serves both developers and end-users. This includes learning how to utilize tools like Swagger or Postman for automatic documentation generation, as well as best practices for writing detailed endpoint descriptions, usage examples, and error handling guidelines.

- **Improving Backend Coding Practices**: Committing to refining coding standards and techniques in backend development. This involves adopting design patterns, writing clean and maintainable code, utilizing version control effectively, and implementing testing methodologies to ensure code reliability and performance.
